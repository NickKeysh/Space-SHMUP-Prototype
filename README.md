# Space-SHMUP-Prototype
The Space SHMUP Prototype was created from the book "Unity and C#. Gamedev from idea to implementation" [Jeremy Gibson].
This prototype covers the following topics: class inheritance, static fields and methods, singleton pattern.
In this game, the player controls a spaceship, shoots different types of enemies. Killed enemies drop bonuses that improve the weapons and shield of the spaceship. If the player takes a lot of damage, the spaceship will explode.
